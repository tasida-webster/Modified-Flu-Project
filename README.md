# Modified-Flu-Project

Overview

We have been given the task of adjusting the original SIR model presented in chapter 4 section 3 of Shiflets’ Introduction to Computational Sciences. The adjustments made to the model will allow us to analyze the spread of influenza in a closed environment, a boys’ boarding school. We began by examining each component of the SIR model--susceptibles, infecteds, and recovereds--to gain a clear understanding of how the model works without any vaccinations given to the boys. Once we understood its implications, we then added different variations to the original SIR model that simulate real world scenarios in context to the influenza outbreak. More specifically, we tested an increase in recovery time, the implementation of social distancing, and the effects of people not following social distancing. This paper will analyze in more detail the methods we used.
